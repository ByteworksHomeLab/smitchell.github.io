I"í<p>Steve is passionate about all of his pursuits. To have fun with Kubernetes, he built a cluster out of Raspberry Pi 4s. Steve ran seven full marathons, did two 100-mile bike rides, completed one sprint triathlon, and climbed Longâ€™s Peak in Colorado. When he isnâ€™t building or learning about cloud-native micro-services, you will find Steve learning Spanish. He traded his annual destination marathon trip with a week of Spanish immersion school somewhere in Latin America each year.</p>
