It started as a friendly Twitter rivalry between me (<a href="https://twitter.com/runner_steve">@runner_steve</a>), and DaShaun Carter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dashaun">@Dashaun</a>) of Pivotal. The challenge: who could create the sexiest Kubernetes cluster out of Raspberry Pis?

We tweeted back and forth for days. Apparently, DaShaun was jealous of my cabling, so he completely outdid me.

It turns out that Raspberry Pi clusters are kind of a thing these days. During orientation at <a href="https://www.thinkahead.com">Ahead</a>, I met two co-workers on my first day that built Raspberry Pi clusters. Thatâ€™s kind of how it is at Ahead, co-workers looking for unique ways to use their technical expertise to elevate their projects to the next level.

You have to work hard to stay current in your profession, but if you find ways to make that fun, learning becomes play. If Raspberry Pi hobby computers don't fit your field, there are other ways to make learning fun. The most common way is through socializing with peers, friends, co-workers. Go to a professional conference. Join a local user group. Invest the time to network with your peers and former co-workers.

In this upcoming series of articles, I will tell you the story of how I built a small data center out of Raspberry Pis. We will uncover the struggles I overcame, along with the triumphs, I enjoyed throughout the construction process. Here are just some of the posts I will be featuring: 

* The parts, prices, power, and cooling.
* Tools and setup to make it easier to work on your Raspberry Pi cluster.
* Choosing and installing a Kubernetes distribution for Raspberry Pis.
* Securing your Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster.
* Monitoring your Cluster
* How to open up your Raspberry Pi to collaborators.
* Backing up your Kubernetes cluster to the cloud.
* Distributed logging to your Kubernetes cluster.
* Getting started with Serverless
* Cloud-native Java Architecture

Let me know what other topics I should include.
