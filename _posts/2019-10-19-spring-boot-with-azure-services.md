In 2019, I created a <a href="https://github.com/smitchell/water-monitoring-azure-example"> project demonstrating integration of Spring Boot with Azure services</a>. Below is a 4-min overview.

The project is a flood warning system that consumes river level measurement events from monitoring stations. The measurements are used issue flood advisories and to send out notifications.

In 2021, I will expand on this idea with with a production quality, cloud-native Spring boot application running on Kubernetes.
