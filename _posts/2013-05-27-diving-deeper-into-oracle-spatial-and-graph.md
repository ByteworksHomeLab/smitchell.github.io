Recently, I attended the [2013 Location Intelligence and Oracle Spatial and Graph Users Conference](http://www.locationintelligence.net/dc/) in Washington. Compared with the Google I/O, JavaOne, and LotusSphere conferences that I have attended, this was tiny, a couple of hundred attendees instead of thousands. It was similar in size to a WebSphere Portal conference I attended in Baltimore. The small size affords greater access to experts and fosters an openness in the sessions not found at mega-conferences. It's a much better experience, in my opinion.

I've been working with Oracle Spatial at Garmin, where I work as a software engineer on the [Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) website. Garmin Connect is part of the Fitness division and is a repository for GPS data uploaded from the users' fitness devices for running, cycling, and swimming. Below is an example of a Connect page used to plan routes. In this example, I was planning a run during my stay in Washington, D.C. I used the heat map overlay to find a route frequented by other runners. This kind of information is helpful when you are running or biking in an unfamiliar area. Heat maps are just one example of how Garmin Connect presents geospatial information to our users.

The Location Intelligence and Oracle Spatial and Graph Users Conference showed me how many more features exist in Oracle Spatial and Graph that we are not taking advantage of today. I came home determined to expand my Oracle Spatial and Graph knowledge and find new ways to leverage this exciting technology at Garmin.

This blog is my journal to reflect on to help me remember what I've learned. Perhaps it will prove helpful to others on a similar path.
