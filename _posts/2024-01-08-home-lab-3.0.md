It's been a minute since my last post, a couple of years. Increasing responsibilities at work keeps me busy, but a few months ago, I re-prioritized my home lab and got back to work.

In my next few posts, I will dive into everything I explored to bring Home Lab 3.0, pictured above, to life.

Some of the things I explored were:

* __Hardware upgrades__ - One nice thing about old servers is that CPUs and memory are cheap. I upgraded all the CPUS (paired [Xeon e52690-v2 3.00Ghz processors for $35](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75279/intel-xeon-processor-e52690-v2-25m-cache-3-00-ghz/specifications.html) to get more cores and support faster memory.
* __Network redesign__ - I removed all but one of the VLANs I was trying to use with vSphere and drastically increased the CIDR range to support the Caligo network on Kubernetes.
* __Virtualization__ - I looked at virtualization from [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io), [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com), [MAAS](https://maas.io), [Canonical LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/), and [Incus Linux containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/). I chose Incus.
* __Storage__ - I worked a lot with [LVM](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm) and [OpenZFS](https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page) storage on my servers and plan to use OpenEBS on Kubernetes. I considered a Ceph cluster outside of Kubernetes, but it sounded too complicated for my needs.

I look forward to sharing more soon.
