It's been a minute since my last post, a couple of years. It's time to et back to work. Well, work might be an overstatement. My home lab is a boondoggle at best. It's no different than any other expensive hobby, like owning a boat. Just last night, I upgraded the first of three servers to the new, faster dual Xeon CPUs that I'm migrating to, and I was fist-pumping in my basement when it successfully booted up. Ah, life's little pleasures.

In my next few posts, I will dive into everything I explored to bring Home Lab 3.0, pictured above, to life.

Some of the topics we'll explore are these:

* __Hardware upgrades__ - One nice thing about old servers is that CPUs and memory are cheap. I upgraded all the CPUS (paired [Xeon e52690-v2 3.00 Ghz processors for $35](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75279/intel-xeon-processor-e52690-v2-25m-cache-3-00-ghz/specifications.html) to get more cores and support faster memory.
* __Network redesign__ - I removed all but one of the VLANs I was trying to use with vSphere and drastically increased the CIDR range to support the Calico network on Kubernetes.
* __Virtualization__ - I looked at virtualization from [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io), [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com), [MAAS](https://maas.io), [Canonical LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/), and [Incus Linux containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/). I chose Incus.
* __Storage__ - I worked a lot with [LVM](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm) and [OpenZFS](https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page) storage on my servers and plan to use OpenEBS on Kubernetes. I considered a Ceph cluster outside of Kubernetes, but it sounded too complicated for my needs.
* __Kubernetes__ - At the moment, I'm going with [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) with [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray), but I've looked a [K3s](https://k3s.io), [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io), [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/charmed-k8s), just to name a few, and that is just to get started. 

I look forward to sharing more throughout 2024.
