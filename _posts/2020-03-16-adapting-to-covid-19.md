Things are changing so fast right now. In my industry, the phrase “being agile” is overused, but today being agile takes on whole new importance. 

COVID-19 may pass relatively quickly, like a tsunami that rolls back out to sea, but not likely. If the economic disruption lasts for months, what will you do?

Our livelihoods depend on our employers’ ability to adapt. Every company must identify it’s best opportunities during and after the COVID-19 crisis and then have the agility to pivot there. Most companies will have opportunities even with the COVID-19 crisis, but they may be very different than what the company has done up to now. 

Companies should involve their workforce in brainstorming ways to sell new or existing products and services in the COVID-19 economy. The responsibility should not rest solely on the shoulders of the C-suite. When an entire workforce focuses on the company’s survival it can do amazing things, especially when your livelihood is on the line.

For cleaning companies, that means retraining staff to safely sanitize customer offices as employees return. For technology companies, like mine, it means using our products and services to help our customers manage a remote workforce and leverage automation to operate with fewer resources. For educational institutions, it means scaling distance learning to levels never known before. As for the healthcare industry, it has to be the most agile of all to handle the coming surge.

If we are lucky, the economic impact of COVID-19 won’t be that bad, and each of us avoids serious complications. If things get tough, I hope your employer has the agility to adapt, and it plays an important role in our nation’s economic recovery. I wish you and your loved ones all the best in the coming months.
